inputs:
  apps_directory:
    description: |-
      Name of the directory where all of the monorepo apps are stored. You can 
      specify a subdirectory relative to the root of the repository. Leave out
      this input if the apps are stored in the default "apps" directory.
    required: false
    default: 'apps'
  
  target_app:
    description: |-
      Name of the app to deploy. This should be the name of the directory where the
      app is stored. For instance, if the app is stored in "apps/my-app", then this 
      value should be "my-app". This folder should contain the package.json file.
    required: true

  gcloud_project_id:
    description: |-
      ID of the Google Cloud project. If provided, this will configure gcloud to
      use this project ID by default for commands. Individual commands can still
      override the project using the --project flag which takes precedence.
    required: true
  
  gcloud_service_id:
    description: |-
      ID of the Google App Engine Project's service you wish to deploy to. By default,
      this is set to "default". If you are using a custom service, you can specify
      the service ID here. If you intend to use a custom app.yaml file, you should
      specify the service ID in that file instead.
    required: false

  gcloud_key_json:
    description: |-
      Service account key used to authenticate with Google Cloud. This key should
      be a JSON string that is minified to a single line and saved as a secret for
      your repository. See README for instructions on how to generate this JSON
      file from your Google Cloud Console.
    required: true

  should_promote:
    description: |-
      Whether to promote the app and route all traffic to the new version. If set,
      the app will be promoted and all traffic will be routed to the new version.
      This is set to false by default.
    required: false
    default: 'false'
    type: boolean

  gcloudignore_path:
    description: |-
      Path to a custom .gcloudignore file. This file specifies which files to ignore
      when deploying to Google Cloud. If not provided, a .gcloudignore file will be 
      generated.
    required: false

  app_yaml_path:
    description: |-
      Path to a custom app.yaml file. This file specifies the runtime configuration
      for the app. If not provided, a default app.yaml file will be generated.
    required: false
  
outputs:
  deployment_url:
    description: |-
      The URL of the deployed app on Google App Engine.
