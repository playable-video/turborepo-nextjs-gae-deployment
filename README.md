# turborepo-nextjs-gae-deployment

This GitHub Action automates the deployment of a [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/) [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) application to [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine?hl=en), leveraging a flexible [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management. It's designed to work seamlessly with monorepo setups and provides flexibility in deployment configuration.

## Features

- **Customizable App and Directory Selection**: Deploy any app within your TurboRepo by specifying its directory.
- **Conditional Promotion**: Choose whether to promote the deployed version to receive all traffic.
- **Custom `.gcloudignore` and `app.yaml` Support**: Use your own configuration files or let the action generate defaults for you.
- **Efficient Dependency Installation**: Turbo CLI and yarn ensure fast and reliable builds.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your application to Google App Engine using this GitHub Action, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

### Enable App Engine APIs

Your Google Cloud project must have the **App Engine API** and **App Engine Flexible Environment API** enabled. These APIs allow you to deploy and manage your applications on Google App Engine. Follow these steps to enable them:

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console:** Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Select your project:** Ensure the correct Google Cloud project is selected at the top of the console.
3. **Access the API Library:** From the navigation menu (â˜°), go to `APIs & Services > Library`.
4. **Search for the App Engine APIs:**
    * In the search bar, type `App Engine Admin API` and select it from the list. Click the Enable button to enable this API for your project.
    * Repeat the process for the `App Engine Flexible Environment API` by searching for it and clicking Enable.

### Verify or Create an App Engine Application

If you haven't already, you need to create an App Engine application within your project. This can be done through the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):

1. **Navigate to App Engine**: In the Google Cloud Console, go to App Engine.
2. **Create Application:** If no application exists for your project, you'll be prompted to create one. Select the region that suits you best and follow the instructions to create the application.

### Service Account Permissions

Ensure the service account used for deployment has appropriate roles assigned for App Engine operations, typically the `App Engine Admin` role. This allows the service account to deploy applications and manage App Engine settings.

### Conclusion
Meeting these prerequisites ensures your GitHub Actions workflow can deploy applications to Google App Engine without encountering permissions or API limitations. This setup is a one-time process per Google Cloud project and doesn't need to be repeated for subsequent deployments.

## Inputs

| Name                 | Description                                                                                   | Required | Default  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|
| `apps_directory`     | Directory where all monorepo apps are stored, relative to the root.                           | No       | `apps`   |
| `target_app`         | Name of the app to deploy (should be the same as its apps/ directory)                         | Yes      |       |
| `project_id`         | Google Cloud project ID.                                                                      | Yes      |       |
| `should_promote`     | Whether to promote the app (route all traffic to the new version).                            | No       | `false`  |
| `gcloudignore_path`  | Custom path to a `.gcloudignore` file.                                                        | No       |       |

| `service_account_key`| Service account key for Google Cloud authentication, as a minified single-line JSON string.   | Yes      |       |

## Outputs

| Name            | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `deployment_url`| The URL of the deployed app on Google App Engine. |

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how you can use this action in your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # The checkout action must run before the deployment step
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Deploy to Google App Engine ðŸš€
        uses: playable-video/turborepo-nextjs-gae-deployment@main
        with:
          target_app: my-app
          project_id: ${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}
```

## Creating Google Cloud Service Account Key

To authenticate with Google Cloud, you need a service account key. Here's how to create one:

1. **Navigate to IAM & Admin**: In the Google Cloud Console, go to `IAM & Admin > Service Accounts` ([link for shortcut](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts))
2. **Create or Select a Service Account**: You can create a new service account or select an existing one. Ensure the service account has the necessary permissions for App Engine deployment. Typically, the `App Engine Admin` role is sufficient.
3. **Generate a New Key**: With the service account selected, navigate to the `Keys` tab and choose `Add Key` > `Create new key`. Select `JSON` as the key type and click `Create`. This downloads the key to your computer.
4. **Minify and Store the Key**: Minify the JSON key file to a single line. You can use online tools or run a command like `jq -c . < your-key-file.json`. Store this minified string as a secret in your GitHub repository (Settings > Secrets).

## Custom `.gcloudignore` and `app.yaml`

If you wish to use custom `.gcloudignore` or `app.yaml` files, provide the paths to these files relative to the root of your GitHub repository in the action inputs. If these inputs are not provided, the action generates default configurations suitable for most Node.js applications.
